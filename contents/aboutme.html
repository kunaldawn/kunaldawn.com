<p>I was born and brought up in Burdwan, a small town in West Bengal, India. I received my degree in <b><i>Bachelors of Technology</i></b> from Sikkim Manipal Institute of Technology, Sikkim and <b><i>Masters of Technology</i></b> from SRM University, Chennai, all in <b><i>Computer Science & Engineering</i></b>.</p>

<p>Programming is my hobby and passion. I spend most of my active free time programming, reading open-source codes and understanding their basic architecture. I like developing small automation tools and experimenting with hobby projects.</p>

<md-divider></md-divider>
<p><b><i>I enjoy working on challenging research and development projects from algorithm and architecture development to deployment. I have worked on projects involving large scale protocol and framework development, process automation framework development, human computer interaction and image processing research projects, delay and disruption tolerant networking research projects, etc.</i></b></p>
